## About Media entity

Media entity provides a 'base' entity for a media element. This is a very basic
entity which can reference to all kinds of media-objects (local files, YouTube
videos, tweets, CDN-files, ...). This entity only provides a relation between
Drupal (because it is an entity) and the resource. You can reference to this
entity within any other Drupal entity.
